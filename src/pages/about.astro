			Hi, Iâ€™m Gundeep Singh. Welcome to my portfolio. Yeah I look like this but usually not that dramatic and with a lot of smiley face.
			I created this headshot using a <a href="https://photo-app.a2e.ai">free tool (photo-app.a2e.ai)<a> if you are wondering.

			Thanks for stopping by. I would like to chat about mentoring, work opportunity or chat about any tech topic or bootstraping a product.
